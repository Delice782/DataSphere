DataSphere is a full-stack web application built to help African businesses collect, manage, and visualize customer feedback. It centralizes feedback and provides insightful analytics through graphical dashboards, allowing businesses to identify key trends and improve decision-making.

This platform integrates Agile development practices using Scrum and was built collaboratively in five 2-week sprints.

## Key Features of DataSphere

- **User Authentication & Authorization**:  Secure login system with role-based access control, ensuring that only authorized users (admins and customers) can access relevant features.

- **Centralized Feedback Collection**:  Streamlines the process of feedback submission, enabling users to easily provide structured feedback and categorize it for efficient management.

- **Real-Time Analytics**:  Visualizes feedback trends, ratings, and engagement metrics in real-time, empowering admins to make data-driven decisions.

- **Interactive Dashboards**:  Provides a detailed view of feedback history for customers and key metrics for admins, with intuitive, user-friendly interfaces.

- **Feedback Responses**:  Allows admins to directly respond to feedback, ensuring efficient management and timely interaction with users.

- **Pending Feedback Updates**:  Continuously processes and updates feedback that has not been responded to, ensuring that unresolved feedback is tracked and managed in real-time.

- **Scalable and Secure**:  Built to support high user loads and ensure robust data security, allowing the platform to grow as needed while maintaining data integrity.
